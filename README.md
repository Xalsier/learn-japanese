## Learn Japanese

This repo essentially has a couple of minigames designed to teach others or myself Japanese. I'm working on making it more robust, but for now there are just 3 pages.

- Kana 1: Romaji to Hirigana, and Romaji to Katakana
- Kana 2: Hirigana to Katakana
- Card: Card deck.

## Policy:

- Romaji will appear rarely for each page. Ideally, the hirigana aids should be enough to read the kanji (So I may need to improve the font sizing)
- Card decks will use a japanese to japanese dictionary. All english representation will be presented as a heat map of meanings rather than a direct 1 to 1.
